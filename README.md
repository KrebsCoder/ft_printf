# Printf

This is the third project of √©cole 42 projects.<br>
Once you really understand how printf works, writing your own printf is not that hard!<br>
If you wish to have your own printf, i really encourage you to do so, you will learn a lot. üòÑ

## üóíÔ∏è About

This project objetive is to mimic the behavior of the famous printf function.<br>
If you want to test the real printf, all you need to do is to open a .c file, include the <stdio.h> library and use the printf like this:

```printf("test")```

The printf can print a lot of types of data, and we are covering just a few of those:

- `%c` print a single character.
- `%s` print a string of characters.
- `%p` the void * pointer argument is printed in hexadecimal.
- `%d` print a decimal (base 10) number.
- `%i` print an integer in base 10.
- `%u` print an unsigned decimal (base 10) number
- `%x` print a number in hexadecimal (base 16), with lowercase.
- `%X` print a number in hexadecimal (base 16), with uppercase.
- `%%` print a percent sign.

For more details and references, you can access this link: 
<a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/printf.3.html">Printf manual page</a> 


## ‚å®Ô∏è How to compile it

```clang *.c ft_printf.h && ./a.out```

- The **.c* means the compiler is going to compile all files that ends with .c
- The ft_printf.h is necessary, it contains all the functions prototypes, it's also creating a printf library and contains the defined macros.
- The get_next_line.h has the header with the prototypes of utils.
- main.c has the test.
- When we compile with the first part of the command line, it's going to be generate an executable file so the ```&& ./a.out``` is saying to the compiler to also execute it.
